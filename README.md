# P-vs-Z
My first gui project

Hello!

This is my first serious project on my studies.
It uses libraries (frameworks): Qt and SFML.
Thanks to them, I've created this application.
It has a gui.
This is a static game entitled Policemen vs Thief (in Polish Policjanci vs ZÅ‚odziej => PvsZ).
You can read rules of this game after launching it.
I think you like it.
Good luck!
